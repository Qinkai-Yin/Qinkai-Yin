## About Me

I’m passionate about using data to uncover insights and drive smarter business decisions. My academic and project experience spans time series forecasting, pricing strategy optimization, and geospatial analytics. I work comfortably with Python, SQL, and R, and have hands-on experience with tools like pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, Tableau, and Git. I’m also exploring machine learning models and cloud platforms such as GCP to build scalable solutions. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and tackle meaningful problems through data.  

Please reach me out at qinkai@uchicago.edu or via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/qinkai-yin/. I'm always open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals. If you're interested in chatting about data science, collaboration opportunities, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me!
