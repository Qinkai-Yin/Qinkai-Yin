## Project Experiences
**Loan Delinquency Risk Modeling**
  – Predicted U.S. loan delinquency severity (Low / Medium / High) using macroeconomic and financial features  
  - Collected and cleaned 13 key indicators from **FRED**, including GDP, CPI, unemployment, stock indexes, and interest rates  
  - Built a **Multinomial Logistic Regression** model to classify delinquency risk levels based on quarterly data (2000–2023)  
  - Performed **ADF tests** to ensure stationarity and applied **first-order differencing** to non-stationary series  
  - Handled **multicollinearity** using **correlation filtering** and **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** thresholding  
  - Conducted **likelihood ratio tests** and used **AIC / McFadden’s R² / confusion matrix** for model evaluation
