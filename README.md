# About Me

I'm passionate about bridging business goals and data science techniques to deliver measurable value. With a background in both finance and applied data science, I enjoy turning complex data into clear strategies.

Currently, I'm exploring **machine learning**, **capital markets analytics**, and **time series forecasting** to support smarter business decisions.

- 🎓 MS in **Applied Data Science** @ University of Chicago  
- 🎓 BS in **Finance (Financial Engineering)** @ University of Macau  
- 📈 Strong interest in **capital markets**, **financial modeling**, and **mobility analytics**  
- 🧪 Built models using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **GeoPandas** for real-world spatial data  
- 🚗 Conducted research on **vehicle perception data (VPD)** and **lane model optimization**  
- 📊 Skilled in **data visualization**, **EDA**, and turning insights into storytelling  
- 📚 Curious about **AI in business**, especially in forecasting, strategy, and decision-making

## 📊 Project Experiences

- **Loan Delinquency Risk Modeling** – Predicted U.S. loan delinquency severity (Low / Medium / High) using macroeconomic and financial features  
  - 📌 Collected and cleaned 13 key indicators from **FRED**, including GDP, CPI, unemployment, stock indexes, and interest rates  
  - 🧮 Built a **Multinomial Logistic Regression** model to classify delinquency risk levels based on quarterly data (2000–2023)  
  - 🔍 Performed **ADF tests** to ensure stationarity and applied **first-order differencing** to non-stationary series  
  - 🧠 Handled **multicollinearity** using **correlation filtering** and **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** thresholding  
  - 🧪 Conducted **likelihood ratio tests** and used **AIC / McFadden’s R² / confusion matrix** for model evaluation  
  - 📊 Found unemployment, CPI, and stock price growth as significant predictors of delinquency transitions  
  - 📈 Visualized predicted category probabilities and residual plots to validate model behavior
