## About Me

Iâ€™m passionate about using data to uncover insights and drive smarter business decisions. My academic and project experience spans time series forecasting, pricing strategy optimization, and geospatial analytics. I work comfortably with Python, SQL, and R, and have hands-on experience with tools like pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, Tableau, and Git. Iâ€™m also exploring machine learning models and cloud platforms such as GCP to build scalable solutions. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and tackle meaningful problems through data.

## Project Experiences  
- ðŸŽ¬ **Box Office Revenue Prediction**  
Built and compared multiple modelsâ€”including XGBoost, neural networks, and Gaussian GLMâ€”to predict movie box office revenue using metadata. The final XGBoost model achieved strong predictive performance and provided valuable insights to help stakeholders mitigate financial risk in the film industry.
- **Loan Delinquency Risk Modeling**  
Built a multinomial logistic regression model on macro-financial data (2000â€“2023) to classify U.S. loan delinquency severity. Applied ADF tests, first-order differencing, multicollinearity checks (VIF), and evaluated with AIC, McFaddenâ€™s RÂ², and confusion matrix.
